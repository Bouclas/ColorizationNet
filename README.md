# Photo Colorization Net

## Info:
This a personal project of mine. The goal was to design, train and use a neural network for the task of human grayscale photo colorization.
Few words about the network design. It is a three-network architecture of encoder-decoder nets, each network takes as input the luminance of the grayscale image 
and its task is to estimate one of the three RGB channels. The design is quite simple!
